# 🏥 Patient Vital Signs & Event Tracking – EDA

This project explores real-world hospital vital-sign data, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, temperature, and clinical event timestamps.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Understand vital-sign patterns and variability
- Analyze relationships between physiological parameters
- Detect potential early signs of clinical deterioration
- Visualize patient health trends over time

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- HR (Heart Rate)
- SPO₂ (Oxygen Saturation)
- RR (Respiratory Rate)
- SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure)
- Temperature
- Chart times
- Event timestamps
- Hours to first event

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Vital-sign cleaning with clinical ranges
- Time-series analysis per patient
- Event-aligned analysis (before vs after clinical events)
- Scatter plots, trendlines, and multi-vital overlays
- Hourly patterns and physiological rhythms
- Correlation and interaction between vital signs

## 📊 Visualizations
- Heart Rate by Hour of Day  
- SPO₂ vs HR (color-graded + trendline)  
- Multi-vital trend over time  
- Event-based HR analysis  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Rolling average vital smoothing  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Missingno  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📘 Future Work
- Build early-warning ML models  
- Predict clinical events  
- Construct a real-time monitoring dashboard  
- Cluster patients using vitals
